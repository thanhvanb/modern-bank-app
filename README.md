This a project building a responsive React JS application consisting of a stunning hero section, high-quality assets and gradients, business stats, reusable feature sections with call-to-action buttons, testimonials, and more.
In this project I have learnt and practiced:
  - React functional components and their reusability
  - React file and folder structure
  - Achieving mastery using Tailwind CSS
  - Fundamental CSS properties to master flex
  - From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
  - Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness on all devices
